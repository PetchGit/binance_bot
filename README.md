Hi, My name is Petch. Warm welcome to you.

This module is named OMBB abbreviated from 'One-Page Multimonitor Binance Bot'. I created this module with these two philosophies in mind.

- Structure in a way that is so simplified that even a python beginner can write a full function trading bot all by himself.
- Design philosophy is one trader looks at 150+ tickers at all times. Because, for example, one might trade ETH based on movement in BTC.

This read me file is going to lead you guys through these topics. Feel free to skip ahead if you're looking for a specific one.
